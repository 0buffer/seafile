Welcome to the DataDupe client.

The DataDupe client is used to download a "library" from the DataDupe website, which is
different from other file sync services such as Dropbox.

1. Create a library on the DataDupe website.

2. Download the library from the DataDupe website.

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on the DataDupe website.

Don't add files to the "DataDupe" folder. That will not make them appear on the website.
