Welcome to use MAXER Drive client.

MAXER Drive client is used to download a "library" from a MAXER Drive website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on MAXER Drive website;

2. Download the library from MAXER Drive website;

3. Files added to this downloaded library will automatically appear on MAXER Drive website.

Don't add files to the "MAXER Drive" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.
