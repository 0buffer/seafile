Introduction
============

Seafile enables you to build private cloud for file sharing and collaboration among team members in your Company/Organization. 

First you create a file library in the web and upload files to
it. Then you share it into a team or with another user.

File libraies can also be synchronized among computers and mobile
devices. You download a library to your PC. Whenever you add, delete
or edit a file, the latest version be uploaded to the server
automatically and then be synchronized to everyone's computer.

Feature Summary
================

Seafile can be used to build a full-fledged cloud storage platform. It
has following features:

1. File revisions
2. Groups, users can create and join groups. 
3. File comments, discussions.
4. Event notifications (for file modifications, file comments).
5. Each library can be synced seperately.

file synchronization. Every library is like a GIT repository. It has
its own unique history, which consists of a list of commits. File
